## ReachOutt README:

### ReachOutt:

- ReachOutt was build out of my frustration with not keeping in touch with friends and family that I care about. I often found myself going weeks without speaking to them. I developed ReachOutt as an automated system to remind me to keep in tough.
- After signing up users can create contacts, people they would like to keep in touch with, and set reachouts, reminders to reach out to them, on whatever schedule they would like.
- It utilizes several API's to send automated reminder texts and ideas of what to reach out about.
- ReachOutt uses Twilio for texting reminders to reachout
- You can find it online at: Reachoutt.com

### Technology stack:

- Built using Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, Vue Native, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and several API's.

### Status:

- Beta.

## Credits and references

1. Projects that inspired me: A terrible google calendar system I built years ago that resulted in me constantly putting off calendar reminders.
2. I use Rufus-Scheduler for my reminders. It's a simple version of a cron job.
